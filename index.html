                        Statements work on variables and produce values or have side effects.
                        Methods take arguments and return results or have side effects. Methods are compositions of statements.
                        Classes are collections of methods and state. The methods can alter the state easily as a side effect.

                        Design your flow of Data.

                        You can do this by defining the responsibilities that need to be fulfilled and the connections that exist between responsibilities.
                        The connections are the interfaces and the interfaces need careful specification.
                        At this level the general purpose of the responsibility should be known as well as the data it requires.
