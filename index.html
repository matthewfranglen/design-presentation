                        You can do this by defining the responsibilities that need to be fulfilled and the connections that exist between responsibilities.
                        The connections are the interfaces and the interfaces need careful specification.
                        At this level the general purpose of the responsibility should be known as well as the data it requires.

                        For object oriented programming the SOLID principles help design the units within a single application.
                        The SOLID principles heavily relate to coupling and cohesion.

                    allows them to change independently

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Content coupling - reliance on internal workings.
                        Common coupling - sharing global state.
                        External coupling - communication with external devices has an externally imposed data format.
                        Control coupling - one thing drives the state of another.
                        Temporal coupling - grouping things because they occur at the same time.
                        Stamp coupling - shared composite data structure. May not have overlap.
                        Data coupling - parameters.
                        Message coupling - communication only via message passing.

                        Tight coupling between classes leads to changes in one class causing other classes to change.
                        It also makes it harder to reason about the behaviour of individual classes.

                        Cohesive classes have functionality which is strongly related.
                        This makes them more reliable, reusable and understandable.

                        Classes that lack cohesion are difficult to maintain, test and understand.
                        A utility class typically lacks cohesion.

                        S - Single Responsibility. Basically cohesion.
                        O - Open to modification (subclassing), closed to alteration. Consider how this interacts with composition.
                        L - Liskov substitution principle.
                        I - Interface segregation. Better to have many specialized interfaces than one general one. Don't depend on what you don't care about. Basically low coupling.
                        D - Dependency Inversion.
